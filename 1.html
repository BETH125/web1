<h2>PROVERB ëž€?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/proverbs.html" target="_blank" tiltle="html5 specification">proverb</a> (from Latin: proverbium) is a <strong><u>simple</u> and concrete saying</strong>, popularly known and repeated, that expresses a truth[citation needed] based on common sense or experience. They are often metaphorical. Proverbs fall into the category of formulaic language and form a folklore genre.

<p style="margin-top:45px;">Proverbs are often borrowed from similar languages and cultures, and sometimes come down to the present through more than one language. Both the Bible (including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs) and medieval Latin (aided by the work of Erasmus) have played a considerable role in distributing proverbs across Europe. Mieder has concluded that cultures that treat the Bible as their "major spiritual book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem from the Bible".<br>[1] In his list of the 106 most common and widespread proverbs across Europe, Paczolay listed 11 that are from the Bible.<br>[2] However, almost every culture has examples of its own unique proverbs.</p>
